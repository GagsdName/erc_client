paper presents a novel model of science funding that exploits the wisdom of the scientific crowd. Each researcher receives an equal, unconditional part of all available science funding on a yearly basis, but is required to individually donate to other scientists a given fraction of all they receive. Science funding thus moves from one scientist to the next in such a way that scientists who receive many donations must also redistribute the most. As the funding circulates through the scientific community it is mathematically expected to converge on a funding distribution favored by the entire scientific community. This is achieved without any proposal submissions or reviews. The model furthermore funds scientists instead of projects, reducing much of the overhead and bias of the present grant peer review system. Model validation using large-scale citation data and funding records over the past 20{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}{\\backslash}??years show that the proposed model could yield funding distributions that are similar to those of the NSF and NIH, and the model could potentially be more fair and more equitable. We discuss possible extensions of this approach as well as science policy implications.","title":"An efficient system to fund science: from proposal review to peer-to-peer

This paper details data preparation, analysis, and layout performed when designing and subsequently updating the UCSD map of science and classification system. The original classification and map use 7.2 million papers and their references from Elsevier?s Scopus (about 15,000 source titles, 2001-2005) and Thomson Reuters? Web of Science (WoS) Science, Social Science, Arts \\& Humanities Citation Indexes (about 9,000 source titles, 2001-2004)-about 16,000 unique source titles. The updated map and classification adds six years (2005-2010) of WoS data and three years (2006-2008) from Scopus to the existing category structure-increasing the number of source titles to about 25,000. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a widely used map of science was updated. A comparison of the original 5-year and the new 10-year maps and classification system show (i) an increase in the total number of journals that can be mapped by 9,409 journals (social sciences had a 80\\% increase, humanities a 119\\% increase, medical (32\\%) and natural science (74\\%)), (ii) a simplification of the map by assigning all but five highly interdisciplinary journals to exactly one discipline, (iii) a more even distribution of journals over the 554 subdisciplines and 13 disciplines when calculating the coefficient of variation, and (iv) a better reflection of journal clusters when compared with paper-level citation data. When evaluating the map with a listing of desirable features for maps of science, the updated map is shown to have higher mapping accuracy, easier understandability as fewer journals are multiply classified, and higher usability for the generation of data overlays, among others.","title":"Design and Update of a Classification System: The UCSD Map of Science","volume":"7","number":"7","journal":"Plos One","issn":"1932-6203","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0039464"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\\"A}lbuquerque, NM 87101, USA{\\backslash}'',[[35.0853336,-106.6055534],[35.2180539,-106.4711629],[34.9467659,-106.881796]]],[{\\\"A}rvine, CA 92602, USA{\\backslash}``,[[33.6845673,-117.8265049],[33.7736521,-117.6780258],[33.5993914,-117.8687519]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Berwyn, PA 19312, USA{\\backslash}``,[[40.045824,-75.4395931],[40.049017,-75.4192269],[40.0303671,-75.474625]]],[{\\backslash}''Berwyn, PA 19312, USA{\\backslash}``,[[40.045824,-75.4395931],[40.049017,-75.4192269],[40.0303671,-75.474625]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Geldermalsen, Netherlands{\\backslash}``,[[51.884365,5.2293588],[51.9355382,5.339583699999999],[51.8471597,5.1138654]]],[{\\backslash}''San Diego, CA 92182, USA{\\backslash}``,[[32.7759882,-117.072053],[32.7790934,-117.0621444],[32.7701644,-117.0809228]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","entry key":"Boyack2011","keywords":"LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL SCIENCE SEARCH DECOMPOSITION MODELS GRAPH","year":"2011","author":"Boyack, K.

Clustering large sets of text documents is important for a variety of information needs and applications such as collection management and navigation, summary and analysis. The few comparisons of clustering results from different similarity approaches have focused on small literature sets and have given conflicting results. Our study was designed to seek a robust answer to the question of which similarity approach would generate the most coherent clusters of a biomedical literature set of over two million documents. Methodology: We used a corpus of 2.15 million recent (2004-2008) records from MEDLINE, and generated nine different document-document similarity matrices from information extracted from their bibliographic records, including titles, abstracts and subject headings. The nine approaches were comprised of five different analytical techniques with two data sources. The five analytical techniques are cosine similarity using term frequency-inverse document frequency vectors (tf-idf cosine), latent semantic analysis (LSA), topic modeling, and two Poisson-based language models - BM25 and PMRA (PubMed Related Articles). The two data sources were a) MeSH subject headings, and b) words from titles and abstracts. Each similarity matrix was filtered to keep the top-n highest similarities per document and then clustered using a combination of graph layout and average-link clustering. Cluster results from the nine similarity approaches were compared using (1) within-cluster textual coherence based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and (2) two concentration measures based on grant-to-article linkages indexed in MEDLINE. Conclusions: PubMed?s own related article approach (PMRA) generated the most coherent and most concentrated cluster solution of the nine text-based similarity approaches tested, followed closely by the BM25 approach using titles and abstracts. Approaches using only MeSH subject headings were not competitive with those based on titles and abstracts.","title":"Clustering More than Two Million Biomedical Publications: Comparing the Accuracies of Nine Text-Based Similarity Approaches","volume":"6","number":"3","journal":"Plos One","issn":"1932-6203","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0018029"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\\"A}ndianapolis, IN 46202, USA{\\backslash}'',[[39.7794767,-86.1700894],[39.8009179,-86.1317759],[39.76040589999999,-86.2004299]]],[{\\backslash}``Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}'',[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}``Columbus, OH 43210, USA{\\backslash}'',[[39.9990626,-83.01733860000002],[40.018325,-83.0071128],[39.990686,-83.040826]]],[{\\\"A}ttawa, ON, Canada{\\backslash}``,[[45.4215296,-75.69719309999999],[45.5375801,-75.2465979],[44.962733,-76.3539158]]],[{\\backslash}''Bethesda, MD, USA{\\backslash}``,[[38.984652,-77.0947092],[39.0226339,-77.0785925],[38.940586,-77.1585612]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","journal":"Menopause","entry key":"Carpenter2016","year":"2016","author":"Carpenter, Janet S.\r\nand Laine, Tei\r\nand Harrison, Blake\r\nand LePage, Meghan\r\nand Hoteling, Nathan\r\nand Borner, Katy","entry type":"article","title":"Topical, Geospatial, and Temporal Diffusion of the 2015 North American Menopause Society Position Statement on Non-hormonal Management of Vasomotor Symptoms"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\backslash}''Chengdu, Sichuan, China{\\backslash}``,[[30.572816,104.066801],[31.4353347,104.8927951],[30.0942976,102.9928859]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Chengdu, Sichuan, China{\\backslash}``,[[30.572816,104.066801],[31.4353347,104.8927951],[30.0942976,102.9928859]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","entry key":"Chen2013","keywords":"Scientometrics Evolving network Co-author Micro-marco analysis","year":"2013","author":"Chen, Y.

Specifically, we would like to understand if and how collaborations at the author (micro) level impact collaboration patterns among institutions (meso) and countries (macro). All 2,541 papers (articles, proceedings papers, and reviews) published in the international journal Scientometrics from 1978-2010 are analyzed and visualized across the different levels and the evolving collaboration networks are animated over time. Studying the three levels in isolation we gain a number of insights: (1) USA, Belgium, and England dominated the publications in Scientometrics throughout the 33-year period, while the Netherlands and Spain were the subdominant countries; (2) the number of institutions and authors increased over time, yet the average number of papers per institution grew slowly and the average number of papers per author decreased in recent years; (3) a few key institutions, including Univ Sussex, KHBO, Katholieke Univ Leuven, Hungarian Acad Sci, and Leiden Univ, have a high centrality and betweenness, acting as gatekeepers in the collaboration network; (4) early key authors (Lancaster FW, Braun T, Courtial JP, Narin F, or VanRaan AFJ) have been replaced by current prolific authors (such as Rousseau R or Moed HF). Comparing results across the three levels reveals that results from one level might propagate to the next level, e.g., top rankings of a few key single authors can not only have a major impact on the ranking of their institution but also lead to a dominance of their country at the country level; movement of prolific authors among institutions can lead to major structural changes in the institution networks. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and the only multi-level study of Scientometrics conducted to date.","title":"Evolving collaboration networks in Scientometrics in 1978-2010: a micro-macro analysis","url":"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/789/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11192-012-0895-2.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11192-012-0895-2&token2=exp=1456852755~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F789%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11192-012-0895-2.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs11192-012-0895-2*~hmac=7cbb789fd6a9fe3fd4b850711d25fa5b38a5c3413ab9a2fc0b0f9807d3d42f1b","volume":"95","number":"3","pages":"1051--1070","journal":"Scientometrics","issn":"0138-9130","doi":"10.1007/s11192-012-0895-2"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","journal":"Journal Of The American Society For Information Science And Technology","entry key":"Emmons2016a","year":"2016","author":"Emmons, Scott\r\nand Light, Robert P.\r\nand Borner, Katy","entry type":"article","title":"MOOC Visual Analytics: Empowering Teachers, Students, Researchers, and Developers of Massively Open Online Courses"},{"volume":"11","note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Tucson, AZ 85721, USA{\\backslash}``,[[32.2332841,-110.9488008],[32.243278,-110.9439609],[32.206903,-110.954997]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","number":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","entry key":"Emmons2016b","year":"2016","author":"Emmons, Scott\r\nand Kobourov, Stephen\r\nand Gallant, Michael\r\nand Borner, Katy","entry type":"article","title":"Analysis of Network Clustering Algorithms and Cluster Quality Metrics at Scale","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0159161"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.165325,-86.52638569999999],[39.22107,-86.4712941],[39.1213559,-86.592398]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.165325,-86.52638569999999],[39.22107,-86.4712941],[39.1213559,-86.592398]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.165325,-86.52638569999999],[39.22107,-86.4712941],[39.1213559,-86.592398]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","entry key":"Goldstone2015","keywords":"visualization perception neuroscience neuroimaging expertise scientific understanding fusiform face area word form area visual-cortex geometric structure fiber pathways naive realism box plots top-down perception expertise Behavioral Sciences Neurosciences \\& Neurology Psychology","year":"2015","author":"Goldstone, R.

The mixed model is applied to four emerging research areas: RNAi, Nano, h-Index, and Impact Factor research using papers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (1982-2009) and in Scientometrics (1978-2009). Results are compared in terms of strengths and temporal dynamics.

While self-organizing maps have been used for document visualization for some time, (1) little is known about how to deal with truly large document collections in conjunction with a large number of SOM neurons, (2) post-training geometric and semiotic transformations of the SOM tend to be limited, and (3) no user studies have been conducted with domain experts to validate the utility and readability of the resulting visualizations. Our study makes key contributions to all of these issues. Methodology: Documents extracted from Medline and Scopus are analyzed on the basis of indexer-assigned MeSH terms. Initial dimensionality is reduced to include only the top 10\\% most frequent terms and the resulting document vectors are then used to train a large SOM consisting of over 75,000 neurons. The resulting two-dimensional model of the high-dimensional input space is then transformed into a large-format map by using geographic information system (GIS) techniques and cartographic design principles. This map is then annotated and evaluated by ten experts stemming from the biomedical and other domains. Conclusions: Study results demonstrate that it is possible to transform a very large document corpus into a map that is visually engaging and conceptually stimulating to subject experts from both inside and outside of the particular knowledge domain. The challenges of dealing with a truly large corpus come to the fore and require embracing parallelization and use of supercomputing resources to solve otherwise intractable computational tasks. Among the envisaged future efforts are the creation of a highly interactive interface and the elaboration of the notion of this map of medicine acting as a base map, onto which other knowledge artifacts could be overlaid.","title":"Visualizing the Topical Structure of the Medical Sciences: A Self-Organizing Map Approach","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0058779"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\\"A}msterdam, Netherlands{\\backslash}'',[[52.3702157,4.895167900000001],{\\\"A}msterdam{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Budapest, Hungary{\\backslash}``,[[47.497912,19.040235],{\\backslash}''Budapest{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],{\\backslash}''47405{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\\"A}msterdam, Netherlands{\\backslash}'',[[52.3702157,4.895167900000001],{\\\"A}msterdam{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''William Barlowlaan 149, 1086 ZR Amsterdam, Netherlands{\\backslash}``,[[52.360574,4.979915],{\\backslash}''149{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Manchester, UK{\\backslash}``,[[53.4807593,-2.2426305],{\\backslash}''Manchester{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Berkeley, CA 94720, USA{\\backslash}``,[[37.87015100000001,-122.2594606],{\\backslash}''94720{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Rotterdam, Netherlands{\\backslash}``,[[51.9244201,4.4777325],{\\backslash}''Rotterdam{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\\"E}dinburgh, UK{\\backslash}'',[[55.953252,-3.188267],{\\\"E}dinburgh{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Galway, Ireland{\\backslash}``,[[53.270668,-9.0567905],{\\backslash}''Galway{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Galway, Ireland{\\backslash}``,[[53.270668,-9.0567905],{\\backslash}''Galway{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Z{\\~A}{\\OE}rich, Switzerland{\\backslash}``,[[47.3768866,8.541694],{\\backslash}''Z{\\~A}{\\OE}rich{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]],[{\\backslash}''Z{\\~A}{\\OE}rich, Switzerland{\\backslash}``,[[47.3768866,8.541694],{\\backslash}''Z{\\~A}{\\OE}rich{\\backslash}``,[null,null]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","entry key":"vanHarmelen2012","keywords":"ENVIRONMENT ANNOTATION","year":"2012","author":"van Harmelen, F.\r\nand Kampis, G.\r\nand Borner, Katy\r\nand van den Besselaar, P.\r\nand Schultes, E.\r\nand Goble, C.\r\nand Groth, P.\r\nand Mons, B.\r\nand Anderson, S.\r\nand Decker, S.\r\nand Hayes, C.\r\nand Buecheler, T.\r\nand Helbing, D.","entry type":"article","abstract":"Modern science is a main driver of technological innovation. The efficiency of the scientific system is of key importance to ensure the competitiveness of a nation or region. However, the scientific system that we use today was devised centuries ago and is inadequate for our current ICT-based society: the peer review system encourages conservatism, journal publications are monolithic and slow, data is often not available to other scientists, and the independent validation of results is limited. The resulting scientific process is hence slow and sloppy. Building on the Innovation Accelerator paper by Helbing and Balietti [1], this paper takes the initial global vision and reviews the theoretical and technological building blocks that can be used for implementing an innovation (in first place: science) accelerator platform driven by re-imagining the science system. The envisioned platform would rest on four pillars: (i) Redesign the incentive scheme to reduce behavior such as conservatism, herding and hyping; (ii) Advance scientific publications by breaking up the monolithic paper unit and introducing other building blocks such as data, tools, experiment workflows, resources; (iii) Use machine readable semantics for publications, debate structures, provenance etc. in order to include the computer as a partner in the scientific process, and (iv) Build an online platform for collaboration, including a network of trust and reputation among the different types of stakeholders in the scientific system: scientists, educators, funding agencies, policy makers, students and industrial innovators among others. Any such improvements to the scientific system must support the entire scientific process (unlike current tools that chop up the scientific process into disconnected pieces), must facilitate and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinarity (again unlike current tools), must facilitate the inclusion of intelligent computing in the scientific process, must facilitate not only the core scientific process, but also accommodate other stakeholders such science policy makers, industrial innovators, and the general public. We first describe the current state of the scientific system together with up to a dozen new key initiatives, including an analysis of the role of science as an innovation accelerator. Our brief survey will show that there exist many separate ideas and concepts and diverse stand-alone demonstrator systems for different components of the ecosystem with many parts are still unexplored, and overall integration lacking. By analyzing a matrix of stakeholders vs. functionalities, we identify the required innovations. We (non-exhaustively) discuss a few of them: Publications that are meaningful to machines, innovative reviewing processes, data publication, workflow archiving and reuse, alternative impact metrics, tools for the detection of trends, community formation and emergence, as well as modular publications, citation objects and debate graphs. To summarize, the core idea behind the Innovation Accelerator is to develop new incentive models, rules, and interaction mechanisms to stimulate true innovation, revolutionizing the way in which we create knowledge and disseminate information.","title":"Theoretical and technological building blocks for an innovation accelerator","url":"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/700/art%253A10.1140%252Fepjst%252Fe2012-01692-1.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2012-01692-1&token2=exp=1456852759~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F700%2Fart%25253A10.1140%25252Fepjst%25252Fe2012-01692-1.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1140%252Fepjst%252Fe2012-01692-1*~hmac=58fbbb8c4993c513dbb75dc70e622f54f0b10a3639e5e1274415262447b031ea","volume":"214","number":"1","pages":"183--214","journal":"European Physical Journal-Special Topics","issn":"1951-6355","doi":"10.1140/epjst/e2012-01692-1"},{"note":"``\\{{\\backslash}''geocoding{\\backslash}``:[[{\\\"A}rlington, VA, USA{\\backslash}'',[[38.8799697,-77.1067698],[38.934343,-77.03214299999999],[38.82729,-77.17216909999999]]],[{\\\"A}rlington, VA, USA{\\backslash}``,[[38.8799697,-77.1067698],[38.934343,-77.03214299999999],[38.82729,-77.17216909999999]]],[{\\\"A}rlington County, VA, USA{\\backslash}'',[[38.8816208,-77.09098089999999],[38.934343,-77.03214299999999],[38.82729,-77.17216909999999]]],[{\\backslash}``Detroit, MI 48127, USA{\\backslash}'',[[42.331427,-83.0457538],[42.45023,-82.910451],[42.255192,-83.287959]]],[{\\\"A}lbuquerque, NM 87101, USA{\\backslash}``,[[35.0853336,-106.6055534],[35.2180539,-106.4711629],[34.9467659,-106.881796]]],[{\\backslash}''Raleigh, NC 27513, USA{\\backslash}``,[[35.7795897,-78.6381787],[35.97172800000001,-78.471063],[35.7158079,-78.8190489]]],[{\\backslash}''Brighton, UK{\\backslash}``,[[50.82253000000001,-0.137163],[50.8735837,-0.03626],[50.8012522,-0.1761194]]],[{\\backslash}''Bloomington, IN 47405, USA{\\backslash}``,[[39.1714266,-86.51860219999999],[39.1751269,-86.509462],[39.163122,-86.5269551]]]]\\}''authorMeta:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined:undefined.undefined","entry key":"Wagner2011","keywords":"Interdisciplinary Science Research Indicators Bibliometrics Evaluation TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM SCIENCE COLLABORATION PERSPECTIVES BETWEENNESS INDICATORS CENTRALITY JOURNALS CENTERS FIELD","year":"2011","author":"Wagner, C.

This literature review began with a narrow search for quantitative measures of the output of IDR that could contribute to indicators, but the authors expanded the scope of the review as it became clear that differing definitions, assessment tools, evaluation processes, and measures all shed light on different aspects of IDR. Key among these broader aspects is (a) the importance of incorporating the concept of knowledge integration, and (b) recognizing that integration can occur within a single mind as well as among a team. Existing output measures alone cannot adequately capture this process. Among the quantitative measures considered, bibliometrics (co-authorships, co-inventors, collaborations, references, citations and co-citations) are the most developed, but leave considerable gaps in understanding of the social dynamics that lead to knowledge integration. Emerging measures in network dynamics (particularly betweenness centrality and diversity), and entropy are promising as indicators, but their use requires sophisticated interpretations. Combinations of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments being applied within evaluation studies appear to reveal IDR processes but carry burdens of expense, intrusion, and lack of reproducibility year-upon-year. This review is a first step toward providing a more holistic view of measuring IDR, although research and development is needed before metrics can adequately reflect the actual phenomenon of IDR.
