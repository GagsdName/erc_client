	<h3>How To Read This Visualization</h3>
	<p>This bimodal network shows two record types and their interconnections. Each record is represented by a labeled circle that is size coded by a numerical attribute value. Records of each type are vertically aligned and sorted, e.g., by node size or alphabetically. Links between records of different type may be weighted as represented by line thickness.</p>
